This project is a web-based application designed to simplify group expense splitting.
It addresses common issues such as uneven cost division, payment tracking confusion, and the need to use multiple apps when managing shared expenses.

# Problem

Managing shared expenses manually often causes inconvenience and social discomfort, including:
     Uneven division of costs when totals cannot be split equally.
     ,Forgotten or delayed payments.
    ,Unclear payment status within a group.
    ,Awkward situations when reminding others about unpaid balances.
    ,Repeated money transfers and lost receipts.
    ,The need to switch between chat apps, calculators, and mobile banking.
# Outcome
The application reduces manual calculation time, minimizes payment misunderstandings, and provides a clearer, more comfortable way to manage shared expenses.
